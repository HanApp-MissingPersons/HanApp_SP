Incidents of people going missing is an ongoing problem in the country. Although Missing Persons cases typically occur after natural or man-made disasters, estimates and reports indicate that a sizable number of Missing Persons instances still happen outside of these settings with children and elderly people with cognitive disabilities being the most at-risk. Although the Philippine National Police (PNP) has created measures to address this problem, the reporting system established has not leveraged the use of technology to streamline the process.
\\\\This research aims to address these issues by developing an application that streamlines the Missing Persons case reporting and verification process, enables and encourages community-based Missing Persons search efforts, and allows users to track loved ones who are at risk of going missing. The application, ``HanApp'', will be developed using Flutter Framework for cross-platform compatibility, and shall utilize GPS technology, Google Maps Platform APIs, and Firebase serverless framework to achieve these features.
\\\\Preliminary results based on extensive review of related studies, applications, and documentations support the feasibility of developing the proposed framework and features of HanApp using the aforementioned technologies.
